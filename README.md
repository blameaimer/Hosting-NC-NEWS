## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

The NC News offers a RESTful API which was built in NodeJS for the purpose to mimic a real world back end service(such as reddit) which provides the information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using node-postgres.<br />
[express](https://expressjs.com/)<br />
[postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/)<br />
[jest](https://jestjs.io/)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

* In your terminal go into a directory and then run the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/blameaimer/Hosting-NC-NEWS
        cd Hosting-NC-NEWS


* Run this code in your terminal:

        npm i


* After you have installed them setup your .env files for DB connection:

        In order to access the correct database you will have to setup 2 seperated connections. 
        Therefore you will have to create .env files where you declare the database name 
        for the associated environment. 
        You will find a .env-example file!
        
* Your package.json should include this:

         "scripts" {
         "setup-dbs": "psql -f ./db/setup.sql",   
         "seed": "node ./db/seeds/run-seed.js", 
         "test": "jest",  
         "prepare": "husky install",   
         }

* Make sure you run these commands before testing:

        npm setup-dbs
        npm seed
* Now you can run the tests:

        npm test
   
#### Minimum Node.js & Postgres needed to run the project
* Node.js >= 17.2
* psql >= 12.9(ubuntu)
